      "description": "DAX is a very powerful and expressive language, but during my journey of learning it, I discovered several quirks that took me awhile to get my head around.\r\n\r\nFor example, the FILTER function does not create a new filter context but a row context. The ROW function is executed in a filter context without creating a row context. How does that make sense?\r\n\r\nAnd then we have that CALCULATE function. First you guess that you need it to put it around your SUM and AVERAGE functions in order to perform those aggregations. Then you realize that it does not do anything! But is this then always true?\r\n\r\nTo demystify these and all the other DAX Gotchas that I bumped into is the goal of this session.\r\n\r\nOnce you have killed them all, then you will start to live life to the DAX!\r\n\r\nAgenda\r\n- Overview of my DAX Gotchas lab environment\r\n- Catch gotchas\r\n- SUMMARIZE\r\n",

Benchmarking on premises is hard enough, but benchmarking in the cloud can get really hairy because of the restrictions in PaaS environments and the lack of tooling.\r\nJoin me in this session and learn how to capture a production workload, replay it to your cloud database and compare the performance. I will introduce you to the methodology and the tools to bring your database to the cloud without breaking a sweat.\r\nWith WorkloadTools, benchmarking will be as easy as pie.",

And why should you care?\r\nFirst of all, it turns out that any (non-) data scientist can actually be of value in the lifecycle of a machine learning solution. But more importantly, it turns out that by using the knowledge and experience from the community, it's actually possible to transform the way you deliver your machine learning solutions to the end user. It turns out it's even possible to do this much faster than ever before.\r\n\r\nIn this session, you'll be guided through a solution that uses DevOps practices to help you overcome classic issues with delivering machine learning solutions. Come for the buzzwords, stay because this is what you've always wanted in your organisation!",

Not much, besides that you do not want to be a pigeon - pigeon post to be specific.  \r\nI have been a DBA pigeon in my past. Managing hundreds of SQL Servers and visiting every single SQL Agent to setup the maintenance jobs, backup jobs or any jobs that would help me to keep the servers up and running. Sometimes using SQL scripts, other times Powershell scripts to deploy or update new jobs, but it was still the same ol' way. Flying between instances like a bird. Until, one day, I found out about MSX and TSX! And now my life is full of happy faces! I want your face to be happy too.\r\n\r\nIn this session you will learn how easy is to setup this hidden and forgotten feature of SQL Server. Will show you how quick is to make a master server and add some new target servers. If you discover an urge to go back to your shop and make a revolution - you can leave before the end - to save the world! Your world! \r\n\r\nThe pigeon says: \"coo roo-c'too-coo\"",

The first version of Azure Data Factory may not have lived entirely up to its nickname \"SSIS in the Cloud\", but the second version has been drastically improved and expanded with new capabilities.\r\n\r\nBut wait, what's that? You have already invested years and millions in a comprehensive SSIS solution, you say? No problem! You can lift and shift your existing SSIS packages into Azure Data Factory to start modernizing your solution while retaining the investments you have already made.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will first go through the fundamentals of Azure Data Factory and see how easy it is to build new data pipelines or migrate your existing SSIS packages. Then, we will explore some of the major improvements in Azure Data Factory v2, including the new Mapping Data Flows. Finally, we will look at design patterns and best practices for development to speed up productivity while keeping costs down.",

For an SSIS (and possibly BIML) person this all looks new and strange. Python notebooks? Scala? Spark? What is all this, and where do I start? Well, you start by coming to this presentation. We’ll take a look at how to approach making an Azure Databricks based ETL solution from start to finish. Along the way it will become clear how Azure Databricks works and we will use our SSIS based ETL knowledge to see if it can handle the common use-cases from our daily jobs. And of course we will also have some fun and see how fast it can go!",

It's much easier to manage different concurrent streams of work if each developer has their own, isolated, dev database.\r\n\r\nHowever, provisioning dev environments is often a slow, complicated and manual process. Often devs simply don’t have the diskspace. And then there's the GDPR.\r\n\r\nYou can solve many of the these problems with virtualisation technologies like containers and clones - but there are various options and they don't all play nicely together.\r\n\r\nIn this session we'll introduce you to Docker containers, Redgate Clones and PsDatabaseClone. We'll explain the pros and cons of each technology. We'll also spend a bit of time discussing how to integrate masking rules to keep sensitive data out of the dev domain.\r\n\r\nAre you on #teamClone or #teamContainer?",

My favoured map for visualising spatial data is the Shape Map (still in preview at time of writing) as it can be customised for specific geographical areas but it can be tricky to use effectively. This session will show how to source suitable Shape Map files, which are an industry standard in the GIS world and widely available, convert them into Power BI friendly format, and customise them to suit your needs using a selection of open source tools, and SQL Server.  In addition the session will show how to prepare the data model to effectively work with the Shape Map. Using an example data set we will bring it it all together to create a selection of interactive maps with the Shape Map visual. Attendees will leave the session with links to open source tools and other useful resources, and the skills and techniques to start using Shape Maps.\r\n",

During my education in Business IT & Management, I learned a lot about what was called Business Intelligence. \r\n\r\nNowadays we go way beyond Business Intelligence. We can better describe it as business analytics, because it all starts at the business process to be completely clear before we can add intelligence to it.\r\n\r\nI finished my education at the company where I also started my first data & analytics job, at Centric Netherlands. There I developed my skills in Microsoft technology which resulted in an thesis about the Azure IoT suite. \r\nAfter finishing my education I developed my professional skills further and after a while switched jobs to be more focused on Microsoft technology in data & analytics. \r\n\r\nNowadays I am a professional Data & Analytics consultant with a specialization in Power BI at Macaw Netherlands. On daily bases I am working on project bases for the bigger international companies.\r\n\r\nWhat I like the most? Sharing my thoughts and enthusiasm about Power BI and related Microsoft Product. I mostly do this in public speaking for the Dutch Power BI user group, presentations at customers and end-user training. But wouldn't it be great to cross borders and also share my thoughts and experience outside the Netherlands? ",
